Project 2 for Spring '25 Data Structures
 If you were not already running at 60 fps, how much improvement did you
get?

I was around 25 FPS, but I now improved to roam around 59-61 FPS. 

(Challenge) Question 2: What is the time-complexity of your algorithm as it depends on the number of nodes?
Since the nodes are now compared by their x-value, it is (logn) + (n) for the comparasions and the time complexity would be O(nlogn).
